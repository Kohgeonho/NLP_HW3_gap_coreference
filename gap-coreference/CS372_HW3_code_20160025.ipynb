The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (\u001b[91mBruce Dern\u001b[0m) who was \u001b[92mFred\u001b[0m's cellmate during \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m incarceration (and his strongly implied lover).\n\nLiam (Roberto Aguire) surprises Aria (Lucy Hale) in Rosewood and Aria admits to Liam the truth about Ezra's new book after he reveals to her the writing is too similar to her own. Alison (Sasha Pieterse) explains to Spencer that she and Elliott (Huw Collins) are more than just friends, but they cannot reveal their relationship as it would be deemed ``inappropriate''. Spencer confronts \u001b[92mMona\u001b[0m (\u001b[91mJanel Parrish\u001b[0m), who tells \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m that she had Yvonne leave her phone on purpose because she wanted Spencer to find the file.\n\nIt is the first film by independent superstar director Dan Garcia, who produced Death Toll and Sinners and Saints. Louisiana Governor Chip Majors (\u001b[92mJames DuMont\u001b[0m) is front in line to be North Carolina Senator Edmonds' (\u001b[91mSteven Bauer\u001b[0m) Vice Presidential nominee. The day \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m is to be announced, Majors goes to a hotel, where he meets a prostitute.\n\nGris exhibited with the painters of the Puteaux Group in the Salon de la Section d'Or in 1912. His preference for clarity and order influenced the Purist style of Am*d*e Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (\u001b[91mLe Corbusier\u001b[0m), and made \u001b[92mGris\u001b[0m an important exemplar of the post-war ``return to order'' movement. In 1915 \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was painted by his friend, Amedeo Modigliani.\n\nWhen Averell's speech is over, the famous stage performer Kate Maxwell (O'Hara) arrives with a group of showgirls. Averell has arranged for Kate to operate both a cattle-buying business and a saloon. Duncan warns \u001b[92mKate\u001b[0m that he will kill anyone caught stealing cattle on his land, and Sheriff Stan Blaine (\u001b[91mNicol\u001b[0m) warns \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m of an impending war over the cattle business.\n\nUpon the albums release, the song ``Threshold Apprehension'' which Lemhouse also provided backing vocals to, was picked by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the Best 100 Songs of the year. In the fall of 2007, \u001b[92mLemhouse\u001b[0m entered school to pursue a degree in Visual Communications (\u001b[91mGraphic Design\u001b[0m). Upon finishing school \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m started Lemhouse Design.\n\n"

      "Vladimir Anatolievich Khodov (Russian: ******** *********** *****; October 9, 1976 -- September 3, 2004) was one of the six leaders of the hostage-takers in the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis. Vladimir was born by medical nurse Alexandra Samoshkina the Ukrainian town of Berdyansk. His father is unknown When \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was three years old, \u001b[92mVladimir\u001b[0m's mother married a North Ossetian military engineer, \u001b[91mAnatoly Khodov\u001b[0m, and moved to Elkhotovo, 40 km from Beslan, where she worked in the maternity ward of a hospital.\n\nBetween May 13 and May 26, 1952, Dunlop caught three no-hitters from Bristol pitchers, one from Ron Necciai in which Necciai struck out a record 27 batters in a nine- inning game, and two no-hitters from teammate Bill Bell. The Necciai game is regarded as one of the most outstanding achievements in baseball history. While \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m recorded 27 strikeouts and one ground ball out, \u001b[92mNecciai\u001b[0m had to garner 28 outs in the game because of a passed ball by \u001b[91mDunlop\u001b[0m on a strikeout in the ninth inning.\n\nAs early as the age of six, he began watching Steve Rickard's NWA-affiliated promotion All Star Pro-Wrestling and its wrestling programme On the Mat. He became an avid fan of the show and was encouraged to begin drawing some of the wrestlers he saw such as Baron Von Krupp. After On the Mat was cancelled in 1984, Conlan started reading Pro Wrestling Illustrated and began following professional wrestling in the United States. Though \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m enjoyed WWF Superstars of Wrestling when it debuted in New Zealand in 1987, the country's first regular American wrestling show, \u001b[92mConlan\u001b[0m favoured the National Wrestling Alliance, specifically Jim Crockett Promotions, partly due to being a fan of the NWA-friendly ``\u001b[91mApter\u001b[0m mags'' and found its wrestlers more interesting to draw.\n\nWill's sheep's milk gnudi scored over Carrie's chicken fried ribeye (as she put sugar in the mashed potato she used), Amanda's eggplant rollatini and Brendan's salmon both scored a point, Jennifer's pork scored over Jonathon's ``punch-drunk'' chicken (he was even threatened with elimination on the spot after he revealed to Ramsay that he used canned pineapple slices for his dish and claimed he had ``limited time''), Paul's eggplant involtini scored over Krupa's stuffed naan, neither Jamie's lamb lollipops nor Steven's seared diver scallops earned a point (Ramsay even compared Steven's scallops to dinosaur toenails), Elise's scallops scored over Chino's dish as \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m used too much miso, Monterray's sea bass and Natalie's lamb both scored a point, both Elizabeth and \u001b[91mTommy\u001b[0m earned a point for their dishes, and finally Gina's pan-roasted pistachio scallops lost to \u001b[91mJason\u001b[0m's pork tacos as the scallops were burnt on the top.\n\nThe Aftermath is a collection of songs released following the 'aftermath' of the Thing a Week project by comedy rock musician Jonathan Coulton. The project was originally intended to be Coulton's eighth studio album. After \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was convinced to start recording in a professional studio by \u001b[91mJohn Flansburgh\u001b[0m, however, \u001b[92mCoulton\u001b[0m decided to scrap this project and start anew for his next album, which would later become Artificial Heart.\n\nSince EDS had its own stock, there was an inherent conflict of interest between the companies- an EDS employee working in Detroit at a GM plant was not primarily concerned about GM's performance, but about EDS performance, so they had a blank check to throw money at problems, bill GM, and watch their EDS stock go up. Finally, as Lee quotes Perot - ``GM doesn't honor its contracts'' - Smith had said \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m would not interfere with \u001b[91mPerot\u001b[0m, but the relationship fractured from the start, with conflicts over promised compensation to EDS executives being rejected by \u001b[92mSmith\u001b[0m, who also sent auditors to EDS to irritate Perot.\n\nIsabel Walker is a twenty-something American film-school dropout who decides to visit her step-sister Roxanne, a poet who now lives in France. Isabel believes that she is there to help Roxanne during her pregnancy with her toddler infant, but later realizes that her father and step-mother sent her there so that Roxanne would help the shiftless Isabel gain some direction in life. Shortly after \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m arrives, \u001b[92mRoxanne\u001b[0m confides in \u001b[91mIsabel\u001b[0m that her French husband, Claude-Henri has left her.\n\nIn addition to an endearingly rough guitar solo, its other outstanding feature is the moaned/whined/chanted repetition of ``Dough/Ray/Me, Do/Re/Mi'' over and over during a long and climactic finale``. In addition to the ``solo acoustic demo taped in (Cobain's) bedroom'' that \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m heard and described in the article, \u001b[92mDeRogatis\u001b[0m stated that a four track version, featuring \u001b[91mCobain\u001b[0m on drums and vocals, Nirvana second guitarist Pat Smear on guitar, and Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson on bass, was also recorded.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Maicon joined Shakhtar Donetsk on a free transfer. He signed a three-year contract. On 4 September it was announced that \u001b[92mMaicon\u001b[0m would join Zorya on loan for six months before joining up with Shakhtar again during the winter break. Because \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m joined Shakhtar after the season had begun \u001b[91mMircea Lucescu\u001b[0m, the Shakhtar manager, decided to loan him to Zorya for the first half of the season.\n\nMaxim Gvinjia ( ) is the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia. Before \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was appointed on 26 February 2010 to replace \u001b[91mSergei Shamba\u001b[0m, \u001b[92mGvinjia\u001b[0m had served as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs since 1 March 2004.\n\n"

He was an All India Congress Committee general secretary from 1980 to 1988. \u001b[92mG.K. Moopanar\u001b[0m was a close associate of Veteran Congress leader and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister \u001b[91mLate Thiru.K Kamaraj\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was a very powerful Congress leader who was known to have turned down high-ranking cabinet positions multiple times.\n\nBecause of the close friendship between Marcie and Peppermint Patty, some have inferred a romantic relationship between them. Marcie is essentially the complete opposite of Peppermint Patty: where Peppermint Patty is more comfortable playing sports, the well-read Marcie prefers a quieter, more studious existence. Although Marcie repeatedly professes her dislike of sports, particularly baseball, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m will occasionally take part in whatever sport \u001b[91mPeppermint Patty\u001b[0m is involved in at the time, though more often than not, \u001b[92mMarcie\u001b[0m, upon showing her lack of athletic prowess and lack of knowledge of the game, usually only succeeds in frustrating Peppermint Patty.\n\nTullus Hostilius (r. 673--642 BC) was the legendary third king of Rome. He succeeded \u001b[91mNuma Pompilius\u001b[0m and was succeeded by Ancus Marcius. Unlike \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m predecessor, \u001b[92mTullus\u001b[0m was known as a warlike king.\n\nOn the June 13 All-Star edition of Raw, Rosa Mendes lost a 7 on 7 divas tag team match teaming with fellow heels, The Bella Twins, Melina, Alicia Fox, Maryse and Tamina in a losing effort to Kelly Kelly, Beth Phoenix, Gail Kim, Eve Torres, Natalya, A.J and Kaitlyn. On the June 17, 2011 edition of SmackDown, \u001b[92mRosa Mendes\u001b[0m teamed up with Tamina and \u001b[91mAlicia Fox\u001b[0m, to pick up a victory against the team of Natalya, A.J, and Kaitlyn. On July 15 edition of SmackDown, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m lost to the Divas Champion Kelly Kelly, despite being accompanied by Fox.\n\nBollinger was listed as the third string QB, backing up starter Tony Romo and his backup Brad Johnson. During week 6 of the season, Romo injured a finger on his throwing hand, leaving him out for a few games. After some failed performances by the veteran \u001b[91mBrad Johnson\u001b[0m, \u001b[92mBollinger\u001b[0m made \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m first appearance for the Cowboys in the second half of the week 9 game against the New York Giants.\n\n\u001b[92mMaria Scharnetzki\u001b[0m was born in Bochum, then a booming industrial town located between D*sseldorf and Dortmund, and after marrying a man named \u001b[91mBackenecker\u001b[0m, spent \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m early adulthood as a working class housewife.\n\n\u001b[92mAlice Perrers\u001b[0m is the protagonist of \u001b[91mEmma Campion\u001b[0m's novel, The King's Mistress. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m appears in Anya Seton's novel, Katherine.\n\nMary McDonagh, Irish poet, born 23 November 1849. The daughter of a Mr. McDonagh and a Ms. \u001b[91mMcGreal\u001b[0m, \u001b[92mMary\u001b[0m was educated at Kildare Place Training College, Dublin, and frequently contributed to the Church of Ireland Parochial Mazine. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m married a Mr. Pearle, and with their infant daughter, emigrated to the USA in 1881, after which date all her work was published in that country.\n\nHowever, before he was able to arrive Mr. Fontayne stopped by, to tell Margie how well she did on her latest paper. Margie, who did not know who was replacing Roy as her date, mistook Mr. Fontayne for being the substitute. When Fontayne explained he is merely stopping by for the compliment and that he is actually taking Miss \u001b[91mPalmer\u001b[0m, who works at the school library, to the dance, \u001b[92mMargie\u001b[0m burst out in tears. In the end, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m decided to attend the dance anyways, escorted by her father.\n\nHis North American appearances have included Hoffmann in The Tales of Hoffmann (Washington National Opera 2001), Gustavo in Un ballo in maschera (Boston Lyric Opera 2007), and Dick Johnson in La fanciulla del West (Op*ra de Montr*al 2008). In October 2010, he made his role debut as Radames in Verdi's Aida for Opera Queensland. The title role in Verdi's \u001b[91mDon Carlos\u001b[0m has been an important one in \u001b[92mGavin\u001b[0m's career. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m made his Royal Opera House debut in the role in 1996 when he took over from Roberto Alagna in Luc Bondy's production and sang it at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1998 as well as in productions at The New Israeli Opera, Opera North, and Minnesota Opera.\n\n"

The Treasurer was named National Director of the Savings Bonds Division for the first time during \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m term.\n\nMr Telford was of the most genial disposition and a delightful companion, his laugh was the heartiest I ever heard; it was a pleasure to be in his society.'' \u001b[92mGeorge Turnbull\u001b[0m states that \u001b[91mTelford\u001b[0m wrote and gave \u001b[94mhim\u001b[0m a poem:\n\nHe directed the White House Climate Change Task Force and spent time as a senior member of various United States delegations, including the 1997 delegation that negotiated the Kyoto Protocol. \u001b[92mGardiner\u001b[0m served the Clinton administrator for almost the entire 8 years that \u001b[91mBill Clinton\u001b[0m was President. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m is currently the President of an environmental consultancy company, David Gardiner & Associates.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Bud awaits his first Valentine (which he thinks is a trick cooked up by Kelly), Kelly must choose one Valentine from the many boys who are attracted to her, Steve plans to take Marcy to Hawaii, \u001b[91mMarcy\u001b[0m plans to pop out from a cake naked, and \u001b[92mPeg\u001b[0m wants Al to say ``I love you'' to \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m.\n\nThe next day, Peggy visits Stacey in hospital and asks her to confess to burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. \u001b[91mPeggy\u001b[0m realises that \u001b[92mStacey\u001b[0m needs to look after \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m daughter so she leaves.\n\nShe agreed and Henry paid her the hefty sum of money.

Although 60.36% of \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m Manchester constituents voted to Remain in the EU, on 1 February 2017 \u001b[92mLucy Powell\u001b[0m voted in favour of \u001b[91mTheresa May\u001b[0m triggering Article 50.\n\nFox pinned Maryse to win both the match and the championship for the first time. She successfully defended the championship for the first time on the July 5 episode of Raw, defeating Eve after feigning an ankle injury. As \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m faked an injury to retain the championship, \u001b[92mEve\u001b[0m was granted a rematch at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view by Raw's anonymous General Manager, where \u001b[91mFox\u001b[0m was again able to successfully retain the championship.\n\nAbed Gubi Nadir (Arabic: **** ****** ****** ``*bid al-Q*b* N*dir; Danny Pudi) is a young, emotionally reserved, Palestinian-American pop-culture enthusiast who aspires to become a director and is currently taking film directing classes at Greendale.

While in the book it is implied \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m ends up with the doctor, the real ``\u001b[92mChristy\u001b[0m,'' \u001b[91mCatherine Marshall\u001b[0m's mother, married a minister.\n\nHer personal best for long jump is 6.55 m set in Bangalore on 5 June 2010 during the second Indian Grand Prix.

Local crime boss Malderone, Gallagher's uncle, has him followed, just in case he talks to the government. Teresa Peron (Melinda Dillon), a lifelong friend of Gallagher, tells the reporter that \u001b[92mGallagher\u001b[0m could not have killed \u001b[91mDiaz\u001b[0m because \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was taking her out of town for an abortion on that weekend.\n\nShe was nominated for a ``Queen of Teen'' award in 2010. In Running in Heels (2011), she featured a new character, Daisy Davenport. \u001b[92mBailey\u001b[0m also wrote books for younger children, including the \u001b[91mWillow\u001b[0m the Woodsprite series, the Topaz series, and the Felicity Wishes series. In all, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m had 22 books of short stories, picture books and young-adult fiction published.\n\nPaula photographs them all with her Polaroid camera. Paula finds a magic marker and they write words on Nick's chest and back like ``pig'' and ``rapist''. They are nearly discovered by a security guard, but he leaves without seeing them. \u001b[92mPaula\u001b[0m eventually confesses to \u001b[91mJulie\u001b[0m that it was \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m who was raped, not her friend -- which Julie had already guessed.\n\nA special department of state looked after his brood mares and stallions. The magnificence of his plate astonished the French ambassador, and the diamonds of his duchess were the envy of princes. The climax of his elevation occurred when, on the extinction of the line of \u001b[91mKettler\u001b[0m, the estates of Courland, in June 1737, elected \u001b[92mBiron\u001b[0m their reigning duke. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was almost as unpopular in Courland as in Russia, but the will of the empress was the law of the land, and large sums of money, smuggled into Courland in the shape of bills payable in Amsterdam to bearer, speedily convinced the electors.\n\nIt starred Academy Award winners Forest Whitaker and Jennifer Hudson, as well as Academy Award nominee Angela Bassett. Lemmons is also attached to direct the Apartheid-set drama Agaat, based on \u001b[91mMarlene van Niekerk\u001b[0m's novel, in addition to an adaptation of \u001b[91mZadie Smith\u001b[0m's best-selling novel On Beauty.
