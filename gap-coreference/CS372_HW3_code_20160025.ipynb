Miller, U.S. Representative from Illinois Frosty Peters, American football player Frank Phillips, founder of the Phillips Petroleum Company \u001b[91mAmy Higgins\u001b[0m, screenwriter John JR Robinson (born 1954), one of the most recorded drummers in history \u001b[92mPhyllis Thede\u001b[0m (born 1954), lived here as a child; since 2009 \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m has served as an Iowa state representative Marcia Wallace (1942--2013), actress\n\ndevelopment-1833 `` Alexander's writing and photo features have been recognized with several awards from the Society of Professional Journalists. Her portraits of Alice Walker and Gloria Steinem were featured on the cover of the Fall 2009 issue of Ms. magazine, commemorating Steinem's 75th birthday. A second portrait of Walker by \u001b[91mAlexander\u001b[0m was the cover photograph of the October 2010 Writer's Digest, and discussed by \u001b[92mWalker\u001b[0m on \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m personal blog.\n\ndevelopment-1765 During the restaurant's 1980s heyday at the top of the Zagat's survey, it was mentioned in Wall Street (1987) by Gordon's call girl when talking to Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Mentioned in Crossing Delancey by \u001b[92mIsabelle Grossman\u001b[0m (\u001b[91mAmy Irving\u001b[0m) as the place of \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m intended birthday dinner.\n\ndevelopment-329 He succeeded to his father's lands because his older brother Michael Komnenos had been abducted and imprisoned in Constantinople. After succeeding his father in or shortly before 1289, Constantine ruled Thessaly and Central Greece from Neopatras. He was assisted by his younger brother \u001b[91mTheodore Angelos\u001b[0m, who died c. 1300. Early in \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m reign, \u001b[92mConstantine\u001b[0m's mother entered into negotiations with the Byzantine Empire and, in exchange for recognizing nominal Byzantine suzerainty, Constantine was invested with the court title of sebastokrat*r.\n\ndevelopment-1739 Alexandra Byrne is a costume designer. \u001b[92mAlexandra Byrne\u001b[0m trained on the Motley Theatre Design Course under \u001b[91mMargaret Harris\u001b[0m before embarking on \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m career as a costume designer in film.\n\ndevelopment-144 When her husband, Henry II, died in 1559, she forced his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, to exchange Ch*teau de Chaumont for Ch*teau de Chenonceau, which Henry had given to de Poitiers. Diane de Poitiers only lived at Chaumont for a short while. In 1594, at the death of \u001b[91mDiane\u001b[0m's granddaughter \u001b[92mCharlotte de la Marck\u001b[0m, the ch*teau passed to \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m husband, Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, who sold it to a tax farmer Largentier, who had grown rich on gathering in the salt tax called the gabelle.\n\ndevelopment-1672 ``Come Clean'' is a song recorded by American recording artist Hilary Duff. The song was written by \u001b[91mKara DioGuardi\u001b[0m and John Shanks, and produced by latter for \u001b[92mDuff\u001b[0m's second studio album, Metamorphosis (2003). The song contains influences of electronica, with the lyrics chronicling the protagonist wanting to ``come clean'' with \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m love interest, from a strained relationship.\n\ndevelopment-1176 Donaldson disputed the CWT fuel-air vapor explosion scenario, stating that ``In the history of aviation, there has never been an in-flight explosion in any Boeing airliner of a Jet-A kerosene fuel vapor/air mixture in any tank, caused by mechanical failure.'' Eyewitness, debris field, metallurgical, and victim injury evidence were all cited by Donaldson as proof of the missile-attack scenario. \u001b[92mDonaldson\u001b[0m acknowledged \u001b[91mJames Sanders\u001b[0m' theory of an accidental shoot-down, and did not rule out U.S. Navy involvement; however, \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m viewed circumstantial evidence of a terrorist attack ``more compelling''.\n\ndevelopment-1067 Gideon stops the impending accident and allows Abbie to cross the street without incident. The next day, the Graingers visit Jack's grandfather, Caleb. He gives the children presents: Cal a Christmas book and Abbie a snow globe of the North Pole. That night Gideon visits Abbie in \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m room only to learn that \u001b[91mGinny\u001b[0m did not mail \u001b[92mAbbie\u001b[0m's letter to Santa Claus.\n\ndevelopment-1181 The new court was moved first to Neuburg, then to Heidelberg, and finally to Mannheim. The D*sseldorf court orchestra was dissolved in the process, but in 1718, many of its musicians were reinstated in the Innsbruck court orchestra headed by Greber. In 1723, after Charles Philip moved \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m court to Mannheim, \u001b[91mJohann von Wilderer\u001b[0m was appointed to serve jointly with \u001b[91mGreber\u001b[0m as Kapellmeister.\n\n"

      "development-1428 Dudley's son, John H. Dean, also played football for Harvard and was captain of the 1933 team. Dudley became friends with Joseph P. Kennedy as the two men spent summers together in Cohasset, Massachusetts. In 1922, \u001b[92mDudley\u001b[0m led an unsuccessful campaign to have \u001b[91mKennedy\u001b[0m admitted to the Cohasset Golf Club, and several of \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m letters lobbying for Kennedy's admission were published in the book, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, by Doris Kearns Goodwin.\n\ndevelopment-1934 Whilst Lynette Porter thought that Gwen became a ``fallen woman'' through her affair with Owen, she observed that this made Gwen's role in relation to Jack in ``End of Days'', analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus, reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext. \u001b[91mGwen\u001b[0m keeps a vigil at Jack's ``Torchwood tomb'' and like \u001b[92mMagdalene\u001b[0m is rewarded for \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour.\n\ndevelopment-1090 Just 2 months later at the Winston 500 at Talladega, racing to the checkered flag, Rusty was clipped by Dale Earnhardt, and flew into the air before violently flipping past the start-finish line, resulting in a broken wrist. \u001b[91mEarnhardt\u001b[0m was visibly shaken by the incident and did make sure \u001b[92mWallace\u001b[0m was okay by checking on \u001b[94mhim\u001b[0m after the race had concluded.\n\ndevelopment-1793 Meanwhile, Mary, having learned about Magicaloid's death, goes to confront Alice, quickly discovering she has powerful strength and regenerative abilities. Despite using various methods to try and kill her, \u001b[91mMary\u001b[0m finds that \u001b[92mAlice\u001b[0m has still somehow managed to survive following Fav's report. Later, Snow White once again comes across Alice, who reveals \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m wanted her to have the Rabbit's Foot, while Winterprison and Nana go to meet with Swim Swim's group.\n\ndevelopment-1269 Going into the season, manager Rogers Hornsby was optimistic that they would have a better club with more power overall, citing Landrith as one of the new players that could help the 1953 Reds be a success. Hornsby made it clear that veteran \u001b[91mAndy Seminick\u001b[0m would be the number one catcher on the depth chart for the Reds, but also said that \u001b[92mLandrith\u001b[0m would get a ``good look'' after witnessing \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m performance with the Reds at the end of the 1952 season, praising that he liked his ``hustle.''\n\ndevelopment-1430 Afraid that no one would believe her, Rita remained silent and she and Ed were married. A few months later, Roger also raped Holly and Rita became overcome with guilt at having not come forward herself. \u001b[91mHolly\u001b[0m did press charges, and when it looked like Roger would be acquitted, \u001b[92mRita\u001b[0m finally revealed that Roger had raped \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m too.\n\ndevelopment-1221 Ellen gets off on the wrong foot with her new neighbors, the Patels, an immigrant couple from India, when a variety of circumstances conspire to make Ellen look like a fool in front of them. After an accident, Spence imagines a parallel Earth in which gays are the norm. Spence rejects Joe's advances because he's straight. \u001b[92mEllen\u001b[0m goes to the hospital after getting the news \u001b[91mLaurie\u001b[0m was in an accident. There, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m meets Laurie's ex, Karen (Anne Heche).\n\ndevelopment-1199 Upon confronting him, she realizes that the man (Philippe Nicaud) is not Lalemand, and she leaves soon afterwards to return to his residence. There, she finds out that the real Lalemand is an acquaintance to Flor*s and Daisy, who have given a false statement when Lalemand was still a suspect. \u001b[91mVirginie\u001b[0m is told that \u001b[92mAnita\u001b[0m was Lelemand's father's mistress and that \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m had permission to profit from Lelemand's $50 million inheritance while she was still alive.\n\ndevelopment-1651 Its follow-up, ``I Don't Need No Doctor'' was also a hit, and the trio of writers also had success with songs for Chuck Jackson, Maxine Brown and Tina Britt. After Ashford and \u001b[91mSimpson\u001b[0m joined Motown, \u001b[92mArmstead\u001b[0m moved to Chicago in 1967 with \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m husband, record producer Mel Collins, and formed Giant Productions.\n\ndevelopment-1854 Immediately hitting the blackjack tables, he begins to blow all his money, resulting in them breaking off in their own directions. While he tries to regain his money through the help of his cousin-in-law, Eddie, \u001b[91mEllen\u001b[0m becomes infatuated with Wayne Newton as Rusty wins big at the dice tables and \u001b[92mAudrey\u001b[0m turns to go-go dancing with \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m cousin, Vicki.\n\n"

      "development-156 Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the western canon of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of fiction and literature in general. Alexander the Great (356BC-323BC) was a Greek king of Macedon and the creator of one of the largest empires in ancient history. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was tutored by the philosopher \u001b[91mAristotle\u001b[0m and, as ruler, broke the power of Persia, overthrew the Persian king \u001b[91mDarius III\u001b[0m and conquered the Persian Empire.\n\ndevelopment-291 Llewellyn failed to take a wicket in this first Test and was promptly omitted from the remainder of the series but responded by performing impressively in the 1897--98 and 1898--99 Currie Cups, which led to his recall to the national team for the first Test of the 1898--99 series against England. Llewellyn impressed by taking five wickets but was surprisingly left out of the second Test. At the end of the 1898--99 series \u001b[91mLlewellyn\u001b[0m, perturbed by the actions of the selectors and seeking financial security, left South Africa to play for English county side Hampshire County Cricket Club as a professional, on the recommendation of South African team-mate Major \u001b[92mRobert Poore\u001b[0m, an ex-Hampshire cricketer on military assignment. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m would star for Hampshire for over a decade, scoring 8772 runs at 27.58 and snaring 711 wickets at 24.66.\n\ndevelopment-234 He died just over two months after arriving. Charismatic was a chestnut horse with four white stockings on his legs and a white stripe on his forehead. He was bred under a foal-sharing arrangement between \u001b[91mWilliam S. Farish\u001b[0m and the Parrish Hill Farm of Dr. Ben and \u001b[91mTom Roach\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mHis\u001b[0m sire was Summer Squall, who had won the 1990 Preakness Stakes.\n\ndevelopment-47 The Movie was either opening or closing night at more than half of those festivals. Director Dyanna Taylor's film about her grandmother, the photographer \u001b[91mDorothea Lange\u001b[0m, Grab a Hunk of Lightning, aired on PBS's ``American Masters'' in 2014 and was produced by \u001b[91mGrossman\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m directed Above and Beyond (2015) for producer Nancy Spielberg.\n\ndevelopment-1737 She was the inspiration for Sophie, the main character in her maternal grandfather's book The BFG. Dahl attended Bedales School, and was discovered by Isabella Blow, a Vogue stylist. Blow referred \u001b[92mDahl\u001b[0m to \u001b[91mSarah Doukas\u001b[0m of the Storm Model Agency in London. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m was able to succeed as a model in the 'mainstream' market, despite being heavy enough to be considered a 'Plus-size' model .\n\ndevelopment-1348 The historical context of creating a grotto in the Vatican Gardens is that on 8 December 1854 the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed by Pope Pius IX at a column of the Piazza di Spagna adorned with a statue of the Madonna or Virgin Mary. The context of the dogma was further accentuated by the visionary message given by the \u001b[91mMadonna\u001b[0m to \u001b[92mBernadette Soubirous\u001b[0m, a young girl of 14, that ``\u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m'' was the ``Immaculate Conception'' and that a shrine should be established for her at Massabielle near Lourdes.\n\ndevelopment-49 Alice (19), Kathleen Mary (12), Gertrude (10) and Mabel (7). In the 1901 census Allen was living at Fox Lane in Leyland with his 2nd wife \u001b[92mMargaret\u001b[0m (Whittle), daughter of James Whittle, a coachman, & \u001b[91mAnn Mills\u001b[0m, whom he had married in 1900. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m was some 18 years his junior.\n\ndevelopment-1313 Since leaving the RCM in the late 1940s Anna has been a member of numerous chamber music ensembles including a string trio with Elisabeth Watson (viola), Georgian String Quartet, Leonardo Trio (first with David Roth, later with Maureen Smith, violin and with Ian Brown, piano), London Harpsichord Ensemble, Glickman Trio and Aulos Ensemble. When in London she knew \u001b[91mSylvia Cleaver\u001b[0m who in 1964 asked \u001b[92mAnna\u001b[0m to become the principal cellist of the Midland Sinfonia Orchestra (later renamed the English Sinfonia). \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m held this post until she retired from the orchestra in 1996.\n\ndevelopment-1248 Susan Batson is an American producer, actress, author, acting coach, and a life member of the Actors Studio. \u001b[91mSusan\u001b[0m's mother, \u001b[92mRuth Batson\u001b[0m, was a noted civil rights activist. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m trained with Harold Clurman, Uta Hagen, Herbert Berghof, and Lee Strasberg.\n\ndevelopment-1894 The Sunday Times writes: ``The show belongs to Kurup's Reno, a cool wisecracking customer and a hot gospel singer: the evening builds to the euphoric release of her show stopper, ''Blow, Gabriel Blow``. '' \u001b[91mSusannah Clapp\u001b[0m of The Guardian wrote: ``\u001b[92mKurup\u001b[0m, is the star - and a gloriously varied one. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m belts out her numbers (she has all the biggest) and soars.\n\n"

      "development-1445 And it soon does. The name given him by the Department is that of \u001b[92mElizabeth Deveraux\u001b[0m; still he inquires further, not believing a woman can have carried the bodies of \u001b[91mJanice May Chapman\u001b[0m, the woman who was butchered and dumped in an alley; so he discovers \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m had been framed by the Rileys themselves; Reed Riley - the senator's son- had been together with all the three women killed in town and when he had found out they were pregnant, he had killed them all.\n\ndevelopment-1051 The actress was in the cast of the Brazilian version of Desperate Housewives, Donas de Casa Desesperadas in partnership with the Disney with the RedeTV! ; her role was Elisa Fernandes, perfect mother and desperate housewife. In the original version, the role was \u001b[91mBree Van de Kamp\u001b[0m, played by \u001b[92mMarcia Cross\u001b[0m. In television, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m had roles in the Brazilian soap operas P*ginas da Vida, Um Anjo Caiu do C*u, Celebridade, Bel*ssima, Am*rica, Amor e *dio, Pequena Travessa and Seus Olhos.\n\ndevelopment-123 At the same time, Lady Elle secretly meets with the Council of Waya to tell them about her conviction that Lyka's the ``last protector'' they have been waiting for to save their clan when the next lunar eclipse occurs. As it is, some of the members are already tired of running away from their normal lives because of the curse. Unbeknownst to them, Lyka is slowly transforming into a wolf by then! After picking up her moonstone from \u001b[91mLady\u001b[0m's \u001b[91mElle\u001b[0m's office, \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m suddenly feels a searing pain in her head and body.\n\ndevelopment-1792 In France it was not until the Third Republic that an actual women's movement arose, a radical section of which, ``La Fronde'' (paraphrasing an older aristocratic-royal civil war), took part in the first revolution. From the start the Social-Democratic party incorporated in its programme the ``equality of all rights''. Consequently, the Social-Democratic women regarded themselves as forming one body with the men of their party, while they kept contemptuously separated from the radical movement among the middle-class women. August \u001b[91mBebel\u001b[0m's book ``Die Frau und der Sozialismus'' went through fifty editions in 1879-1910, and was translated into fourteen languages. In this work the position of woman in the Socialistic state of the future is described. In general the radical middle-class emancipation agrees with the Social-Democratic both in the political and in the ethical spheres. A proof of this is furnished by the works of the Swedish writer \u001b[92mEllen Key\u001b[0m, especially by \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m book ``*ber Ehe und Liebe'' 'On marriage and love', which enjoy a very large circulation throughout the world.\n\ndevelopment-47 The Movie was either opening or closing night at more than half of those festivals. Director Dyanna Taylor's film about her grandmother, the photographer \u001b[91mDorothea Lange\u001b[0m, Grab a Hunk of Lightning, aired on PBS's ``American Masters'' in 2014 and was produced by \u001b[91mGrossman\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m directed Above and Beyond (2015) for producer Nancy Spielberg.\n\ndevelopment-529 In 1927, she won a cash prize for her designs, from the Rondith Corporation. Muir focused on designing modern private homes, especially for clients in Malibu, Pacific Palisades, and other affluent Southern California communities. Among her celebrity clients were \u001b[91mShirley Temple\u001b[0m, Robert Taylor and \u001b[91mBarbara Stanwyck\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m earned her architecture license in 1934, and continued at the Byers office until 1942.\n\ndevelopment-777 On 9 December 2010 Fern*ndez was questioned as a witness in relation to Operation Galgo, an investigation into a Spanish athletics doping ring being carried out by the Guardia Civil. She denied all charges of doping and was allowed to remain on the team that represented Spain at the European Cross Country Championships held in Albufeira, Portugal. \u001b[91mEl Pa*s\u001b[0m reported that her coach, \u001b[92mManuel Pascua\u001b[0m, admitted to police that \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m organised doping schedules for his athletes.\n\ndevelopment-1873 In May 2013, ``Fire Starter'', a song co-written with Lindy Robbins and \u001b[91mJulia Michaels\u001b[0m, was released on the fourth studio album by \u001b[92mDemi Lovato\u001b[0m, on Hollywood Records. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, becoming \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m best-selling debut week of her career.\n\ndevelopment-1803 When the judge asks her about her baby brother being ``different'' from her, the only thought that occurs to her is that her brother is a boy, while she is a girl. The judge recognizes that the family situation in the \u001b[91mRichards\u001b[0m home is superior for \u001b[92mEllen\u001b[0m in every way except for the fact that \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m is white, growing up in a black household.\n\ndevelopment-1253 Isomgosiono, ``Queen Anne'', 1703 \u001b[91mTreaty Signer\u001b[0m for Pan NA Federation along with Sachem \u001b[91mGeorge Skipper\u001b[0m of the Nottoway/Chero-en-ha-ka/Iroquois. These pan Native American communities go back to what may be communities formed per the one reference on the Capt John Smith Map of 1656 listing a single Shawnee group in the Susquahanna Valley when \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m mapped the area at that time.\n\n"
