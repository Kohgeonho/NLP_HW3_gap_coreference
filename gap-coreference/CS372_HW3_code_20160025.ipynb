      "development-1590 Hughes captained England for every one of Mercer's seven games in charge, and initially maintained the role when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey's permanent successor. However, after the first two qualifiers for the 1976 European Championships, \u001b[92mRevie\u001b[0m decided to drop \u001b[91mHughes\u001b[0m from the team. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m gave the captaincy to his former Blackpool team-mate Alan Ball, and Hughes appeared only twice for England in 1975.\n\ndevelopment-524 The late 1950s to mid-1970s is viewed as the ``golden age'' for New Zealand in the sport and saw Denny Hulme crowned as World Drivers' Championship in 1967. New Zealand drivers have been absent from Formula One events from 1984 with \u001b[91mMike Thackwell\u001b[0m to 2017 when \u001b[92mBrendon Hartley\u001b[0m is expected to make \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m F1 debut in the 2017 United States Grand Prix.\n\ndevelopment-502 He served as flag officer (ashore), Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, Scotland, and was made Admiral in 1942. He then served as flag officer-in-charge, in Cardiff before retiring from the navy in 1945. Following his retirement from the navy, \u001b[92mHugh Binney\u001b[0m was chosen to replace \u001b[91mErnest Clark\u001b[0m as Governor of Tasmania, a post \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m took up on 24 December 1945.\n\ndevelopment-894 Maya confesses her love to Yash, but Yash refutes her advances, as he does not want her to become his weakness in his professional life. However, Swati (\u001b[91mSandhya Mridul\u001b[0m), the wife of Yash's coworker and good friend, convinces Yash that he is in love with \u001b[92mMaya\u001b[0m as well and Yash decides to get married to \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m.\n\ndevelopment-1169 Both men denied taking the badge. When Jude and the others stayed inside Antonessen's truck, the mob threatened them, saying ``Nigger, we can kill you.'' During this confrontation, \u001b[91mRyan Packard\u001b[0m took \u001b[92mJude\u001b[0m to the ground, where other off-duty officers held \u001b[94mhim\u001b[0m down and searched him for the badge.\n\ndevelopment-1352 In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani characterized Prozac Nation as ``by turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware,'' comparing it with the ``raw candor of Joan Didion's essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song.'' While praising \u001b[92mWurtzel\u001b[0m's prose style as ``sparkling'' and ``luminescent,'' \u001b[91mKakutani\u001b[0m thought the memoir ``would have benefited enormously from some strict editing'' and said that its ``self-pitying passages make the reader want to shake the author, and remind \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m that there are far worse fates than growing up during the '70s in New York and going to Harvard.''\n\ndevelopment-1659 Nina began to displace all her aggression toward her father's former wife. Even after Donna exonerated Daisy for Zach's murder, Nina could not waive her intense feelings of hate towards her. At \u001b[91mDonna\u001b[0m's wedding to Benny Sago, \u001b[92mNina\u001b[0m came with a gun. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m tried to shoot Donna, but luckily missed.\n\ndevelopment-1792 In France it was not until the Third Republic that an actual women's movement arose, a radical section of which, ``La Fronde'' (paraphrasing an older aristocratic-royal civil war), took part in the first revolution. From the start the Social-Democratic party incorporated in its programme the ``equality of all rights''. Consequently, the Social-Democratic women regarded themselves as forming one body with the men of their party, while they kept contemptuously separated from the radical movement among the middle-class women. August \u001b[91mBebel\u001b[0m's book ``Die Frau und der Sozialismus'' went through fifty editions in 1879-1910, and was translated into fourteen languages. In this work the position of woman in the Socialistic state of the future is described. In general the radical middle-class emancipation agrees with the Social-Democratic both in the political and in the ethical spheres. A proof of this is furnished by the works of the Swedish writer \u001b[92mEllen Key\u001b[0m, especially by \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m book ``*ber Ehe und Liebe'' 'On marriage and love', which enjoy a very large circulation throughout the world.\n\ndevelopment-1566 Additionally, they can't move because of the cold. They are surrounded by the enemy, and don't know what to do anymore. Ken, Jinpei and Ryu run to their aid. Through the actions of \u001b[91mKen\u001b[0m and the others, the magma mega cannon is destroyed. With the warm friendship of \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m comrades, \u001b[92mJoe\u001b[0m has been freed from his pain.\n\ndevelopment-638 She was appointed by Richard Nixon but continued serving as Treasurer through Gerald Ford's term in office after Nixon resigned in August 1974. \u001b[92mNeff\u001b[0m took office at a time when the role of \u001b[91mTreasurer\u001b[0m was being reorganized. The Treasurer was named National Director of the Savings Bonds Division for the first time during \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m term.\n\n"

On \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m way out, \u001b[92mRaju\u001b[0m gets beat up by the hired gangsters, though later rescued by Shera (\u001b[91mSanjay Dutt\u001b[0m), also an Indian living in London.\n\ndevelopment-1564 Liam (Roberto Aguire) surprises Aria (Lucy Hale) in Rosewood and Aria admits to Liam the truth about Ezra's new book after he reveals to her the writing is too similar to her own. Alison (Sasha Pieterse) explains to Spencer that she and Elliott (Huw Collins) are more than just friends, but they cannot reveal their relationship as it would be deemed ``inappropriate''. Spencer confronts \u001b[92mMona\u001b[0m (\u001b[91mJanel Parrish\u001b[0m), who tells \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m that she had Yvonne leave her phone on purpose because she wanted Spencer to find the file.\n\ndevelopment-1282 Upon the albums release, the song ``Threshold Apprehension'' which Lemhouse also provided backing vocals to, was picked by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the Best 100 Songs of the year. In the fall of 2007, \u001b[92mLemhouse\u001b[0m entered school to pursue a degree in Visual Communications (\u001b[91mGraphic Design\u001b[0m). Upon finishing school \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m started Lemhouse Design.\n\ndevelopment-562 He was named to the NCAA All-Tournament team in 1980, and two first All Star teams in 1981. He began his playing career with the Pittsburgh Penguins who drafted him in the 6th round of the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. \u001b[92mChorney\u001b[0m was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for a 6th round choice (\u001b[91mStuart Marston\u001b[0m) in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. After spending a season with the Kings, \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m was signed by the Washington Capitals but failed to earn a spot on the roster.\n\ndevelopment-954 Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire (Alexie Gilmore), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike (\u001b[91mHenry Simmons\u001b[0m), whose writing class is more successful than \u001b[92mLance\u001b[0m's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie (Mitzi McCall).\n\ndevelopment-146 Rocky intervenes, and after seemingly beating the living daylights out of the supposed thugs (the scene is similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme's introductory action sequence from Hard Target (1993)), introduces himself to Natasha, and proceeds to show himself off as a charming professional with a heart of gold. Somewhat awed, Natasha offers Rocky an invitation for tea later in the evening, which he accepts. When Rocky arrives at \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m villa later in the evening, he is confronted by several obstacles, \u001b[92mNatasha\u001b[0m's sister Sweety (\u001b[91mSupriya Pilgaonkar\u001b[0m), the jealous Tommy and the family's pet dog.\n\ndevelopment-1571 And the Lord said to him, ``How can you say, 'I have fulfilled the Law and the Prophets', when it is written in the Law: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself', and many of your brothers, sons of \u001b[91mAbraham\u001b[0m, are covered with filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of many good things, none of which goes out to them?'' And \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m (\u001b[92mJesus\u001b[0m) turned and said to Simon his disciple, who was sitting by him, ``Simon son of John, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.''(\n\ndevelopment-894 Maya confesses her love to Yash, but Yash refutes her advances, as he does not want her to become his weakness in his professional life. However, Swati (\u001b[91mSandhya Mridul\u001b[0m), the wife of Yash's coworker and good friend, convinces Yash that he is in love with \u001b[92mMaya\u001b[0m as well and Yash decides to get married to \u001b[94mher\u001b[0m.\n\n"

Esme arrives not long after Amy, but is surprised to see her. It seems clear that they have not spoken for quite some time, and Esme is so glad to finally see her daughter again that she begins to weep as she hugs \u001b[91mAmy\u001b[0m. Once \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m has recovered, we learn that \u001b[92mEsme\u001b[0m has been acting as a nurse on a television show, and that Frank had been trying to marry Esme practically since the last time Amy had visited.\n\ndevelopment-1926 However, Phil rejects Shirley so she apologises to Heather, who is staying with Minty, but she refuses to forgive her friend. Heather is upset when she hears Minty plans to marry Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), but offers to help buy a ring. However, when Sam reveals \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m only agreed to marry \u001b[91mMinty\u001b[0m in order to shut him up, Minty apologises to \u001b[91mHeather\u001b[0m, and she says when they married it gave her the confidence to stand up for herself.\n\ndevelopment-798 Five-light Apse window for the Cathedral depicts ``The Annunciation'', ``The Visitation'', ``Virgin and Child in Majesty'', ``The Nativity'' and ``The Presentation at the Temple.'' The architect of the Cathedral was Francis Leonard Hodgson Fleming (1875--1950). Fleming had first met Parsons when Fleming worked in the office of \u001b[91mHerbert Baker\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was an assistant there and later a partner, \u001b[92mFleming\u001b[0m became a good friend of Parsons and gave him several South African commissions.\n\ndevelopment-119 Heightened political pressure and illness pushed Gordillo out from public life for about a year, though she did hold on to her post as the PRI secretary general. In early 2005 Gordillo returned to public life and Roberto Madrazo greeted her with open arms. According to PRI rules, Gordillo, as secretary general of the party, should have replaced Madrazo when \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m stepped down; but, in a surprise move, \u001b[91mMariano Palacios Alcocer\u001b[0m took \u001b[92mMadrazo\u001b[0m's position instead of Gordillo, who publicly broke with Madrazo just few days before Palacios Alcocer's election.\n\ndevelopment-840 He was renamed Don Charles to avoid potential confusion with Tony Bennett, and released his biggest seller ``Walk With Me My Angel'' in January 1962. Written by Geoff Goddard, and produced by Meek, the single just made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Not that he knew it at the time, but lack of further chart activity, would leave \u001b[92mCharles\u001b[0m with the one-hit wonder tag. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m appeared on several teen based television program mes, and released a cover version of \u001b[91mBen E.

Discovering the bartender Horace trapped under debris, Peter saves his life and is proclaimed a hero by local newsman Tom Tucker. When told that \u001b[94mhe\u001b[0m saved \u001b[91mHorace\u001b[0m from a burning building, \u001b[92mPeter\u001b[0m replied with disbelief, ``That freakin' place was on fire?!''\n\ndevelopment-1581 Jenkins then joined the Reform Party, but Endean was selected as the party's candidate instead. Endean represented the Auckland electorates of Parnell from 1930 to 1938, and then Remuera from 1938 to 1943. When the Reform Party merged with United to form the National Party in 1936, \u001b[92mEndean\u001b[0m became a National Party member. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was controversial within the National Party and in the party's 50-year history written by \u001b[91mBarry Gustafson\u001b[0m, it is remarked that in 1938, there was ``some resistance to the National MP'' in the Remuera electorate.\n\ndevelopment-1799 Peters sings four songs on the CD accompanying a 2005 children's picture book Dewey Doo-it Helps Owlie Fly Again, the proceeds of which benefit the Christopher Reeve Foundation. Her co-star from Sunday in the Park with George, Mandy Patinkin, also sings on the CD. To support Broadway Barks, the animal adoption charity that \u001b[94mshe\u001b[0m co-founded with \u001b[91mMary Tyler Moore\u001b[0m, \u001b[92mPeters\u001b[0m has written three children's books, illustrated by Liz Murphy.\n\ndevelopment-1692 She has also worked in the opera world.

Hornsby made it clear that veteran \u001b[91mAndy Seminick\u001b[0m would be the number one catcher on the depth chart for the Reds, but also said that \u001b[92mLandrith\u001b[0m would get a ``good look'' after witnessing \u001b[94mhis\u001b[0m performance with the Reds at the end of the 1952 season, praising that he liked his ``hustle.''\n\ndevelopment-886 In this episode, his character's last name is Peters (later Hale).

      "development-156 Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the western canon of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of fiction and literature in general. Alexander the Great (356BC-323BC) was a Greek king of Macedon and the creator of one of the largest empires in ancient history. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m was tutored by the philosopher \u001b[91mAristotle\u001b[0m and, as ruler, broke the power of Persia, overthrew the Persian king \u001b[91mDarius III\u001b[0m and conquered the Persian Empire.\n\ndevelopment-906 At the Top 24 round as part of Group 1, Jermaine sang ``Steal My Girl'' together with Vanessa Devi, \u001b[91mShanice Hedger\u001b[0m and \u001b[91mRuth Matthews\u001b[0m as the whole group, and ``Blank Space'' in the solo round, and was sent through to the next round. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m sang ``Lay Me Down'' in the Top 16 round and made it through to the finals, singing ``A Sky Full of Stars'' as a group of top 10 finalists and ``Almost Is Never Enough'' in the solo segment of the Identity round.\n\ndevelopment-590 Roscoe and his wife had seven sons and three daughters, including William Stanley Roscoe (1782--1843), a poet, Thomas Roscoe (1791--1871), translator from Italian, and Henry (1800--1836), a legal writer who wrote his father's biography. Henry's wife, Maria Roscoe (\u001b[91mn*e Fletcher\u001b[0m) (1798-1885), was the author of \u001b[92mVittoria Colonna\u001b[0m: \u001b[94mHer\u001b[0m Life and Times, and their son Henry Enfield Roscoe (1833--1915) was a chemist and vice-chancellor of the University of London.\n\ndevelopment-610 In the older records, the village is known as Bukovinka and so is named in 1543 when it appeared in the records regarding the sale of the estate in Desky zemsk* (State property records). In 1628, \u001b[92mVald*tejn\u001b[0m acquired Bukovina from \u001b[91mKarel Kapoun\u001b[0m from Svojkov. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m also purchased other manors in the surrounding area and together they were later attached to his Hostinn* estate.\n\ndevelopment-1427 As part of his breeding and training programs he was part owner (with Harold Syner of Wajima fame) of Alamare Farm in Lexington, Kentucky and joint owner of Meadow Wood Training Center in Ocala, Florida. DiMauro is responsible for mentoring and developing many of the horsemen involved in Thoroughbred racing today. His experience and insight into the sport has earned him much respect among many. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m gave \u001b[91mRichard Migliore\u001b[0m a chance, and \u001b[91mRichard ``The Mig\u001b[0m,'' was a well-known jockey for many years until his retirement in June 2010, and is still involved in the sport with the New York Racing Association.\n\ndevelopment-1306 Like many other religious houses, they profited by the embarrassment of lesser barons and knights, and in 1232 were able to purchase the greater part of the manor of Alvingham from John de Melsa, his father and mother, by paying off their debt of 871*2 marks to certain Jews. Their claim to two parts of the church of St. Andrew, Market Stainton, involved them in a struggle with \u001b[92mRobert Grosteste\u001b[0m, bishop of Lincoln, in the reign of \u001b[91mHenry III\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m revoked the appropriation made by his predecessor, but in 1245 the priory's appeal to Pope Innocent IV was finally successful.\n\ndevelopment-536 The orchestra moved on to the Mound Club in St. Louis, Missouri where he signed with William Foor-Robinson Orchestra Corporation of America. The Tal Henry orchestra went on to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ed Fishman introduced Bob Hope and \u001b[91mGeorge Burns\u001b[0m to \u001b[92mTal Henry\u001b[0m and \u001b[94mHis\u001b[0m North Carolinians and booked them into the Stanley in Pittsburgh.\n\ndevelopment-779 Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works. With the publication in 1939 of \u001b[92mMary Lascelles\u001b[0m's \u001b[91mJane Austen\u001b[0m and \u001b[94mHer\u001b[0m Art, the academic study of Austen took hold.\n\ndevelopment-1210 All her force, and it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the assertion, 'I love. I hate. I suffer. '''-- Virginia Woolf. The Daily Telegraph's, Lucy Hughes-Hallett argues that Villette is greater than Bront*'s most famous work \u001b[91mJane Eyre\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m states that the novel is ``an astonishing piece of writing, a book in which phantasmagorical set pieces alternate with passages of minute psychological exploration, and in which \u001b[92mBront*\u001b[0m's marvellously flexible prose veers between sardonic wit and stream-of-consciousness, in which the syntax bends and flows and threatens to dissolve completely in the heat of madness, drug-induced hallucination and desperate desire.''\n\ndevelopment-171 He was born in New York City, studied in Paris, and after returning to the United States worked for Leslie's, Harper's Weekly and similar publications. He also contributed to the humorous weekly magazine Vanity Fair. The \u001b[92mMark Twain\u001b[0m book A Tramp Abroad contains more than 20 pictures by \u001b[91mDay\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m married Maria Theresa Miller around 1859, who died in 1875.\n\n"

Mme. \u001b[92mLouise Homer\u001b[0m, noted contralto, who thrilled Metropolitan Opera audiences as Amneris in '\u001b[91mAida\u001b[0m' and in other famous roles, died here this afternoon of a heart ailment at the age of 76. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m had been in ill health since the death of her youngest daughter, Joy, on Oct.\n\ndevelopment-962 After Dark Shadows ended in 1971, she had a brief stint as reporter Marge Grey on All My Children (1973). She continued acting on stage as \u001b[92mWarda\u001b[0m in Jean Genet's The Screens (1971--72) and The Lady in Gray/The Fly in Happy End (1977) which co-starred \u001b[91mMeryl Streep\u001b[0m and Christopher Lloyd. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m appeared in the Broadway premiere of The Suicide (1980) with Derek Jacobi, and appeared opposite Geraldine Page, Carrie Nye and Madeline Sherwood in an off-Broadway revival of The Madwoman of Chaillot.\n\ndevelopment-1230 Ang Lalaking Nagmahal Sa Akin by \u001b[91mVanessa\u001b[0m, a romance writer from PHR, is the story of \u001b[92mFlor\u001b[0m who moves from the province to the city to in a hotel. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m falls in love with the owner of the hotel, Zephy.\n\ndevelopment-35 Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, saying that ``does breakup about as good as anybody'' and that he doesn't believe Keith is ``capable of turning in a weak vocal performance.'' \u001b[92mBobby Peacock\u001b[0m of Roughstock gave the song a 3.5/5 rating, saying that the production is ``looser and funkier'' than on \u001b[91mKeith\u001b[0m's other songs. \u001b[94mHe\u001b[0m goes on to say that it ``contrasts with the more downbeat lyrics of a fairly standard broken-heart song.''\n\ndevelopment-160 He was promoted to major on 14 August 1790, and to lieutenant-colonel on 9 December 1793. On 4 July 1785 at Barnes in Surrey, he married \u001b[92mHenrietta Anne Hoare\u001b[0m, a daughter of Sir Richard Hoare, 1st Baronet of Barn Elms, a partner in the City of London banking firm C. Hoare & Co, and \u001b[91mFrances Anne Acland\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m survived him and in 1795 remarried to Captain the Hon. Matthew Fortescue (1754--1842), Royal Navy, younger brother of Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue of Castle Hill, Filleigh, Devon.\n\ndevelopment-1259 Close starred in Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her in the same year, this would be one of many future collaborations with director Rodrigo Garcia. In 2004, she played \u001b[92mClaire Wellington\u001b[0m, an uptight socialite in the comedy The Stepford Wives opposite \u001b[91mNicole Kidman\u001b[0m and Christopher Walken. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m provided the voice of the Blue Fairy in the English version of Pinocchio (2002) and Granny in the animated film Hoodwinked (2005).\n\ndevelopment-837 Lawrence asks Nefarious for his employ again and the two take the ship, flying off into space. A clear parody of \u001b[91mBritney Spears\u001b[0m, Courtney Gears (voiced by \u001b[92mMelissa Disney\u001b[0m in Up Your Arsenal, Nika Futterman in Ratchet: Deadlocked) is a female pop star robot who occasionally gives out prizes on the show, Annihilation Nation. \u001b[94mHer\u001b[0m music and videos are popular in the Solana Galaxy.\n\ndevelopment-529 In 1927, she won a cash prize for her designs, from the Rondith Corporation. Muir focused on designing modern private homes, especially for clients in Malibu, Pacific Palisades, and other affluent Southern California communities. Among her celebrity clients were \u001b[91mShirley Temple\u001b[0m, Robert Taylor and \u001b[91mBarbara Stanwyck\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m earned her architecture license in 1934, and continued at the Byers office until 1942.\n\ndevelopment-1066 Alessandro Turchi worked briefly under him. As the most talented member of his father's workshop, he undoubtedly executed many works that are attributed to his father. Works that have been clearly isolated as \u001b[92mCarlo\u001b[0m's own are more precise and delicate, both technically and in the physical types; they lack \u001b[91mVeronese\u001b[0m's bravura, whether in the line and wash of a chiaroscuro drawing or in the richly layered pigments that make an embroidered drape. \u001b[94mHis\u001b[0m early signed works show the influence of both his father and the Bassano family by whom he was trained.\n\ndevelopment-1986 Her personal best for long jump is 6.55 m set in Bangalore on 5 June 2010 during the second Indian Grand Prix. She became only the fourth Indian woman to cross 6.50 m, joining \u001b[91mAnju Bobby George\u001b[0m (6.83 m), J.J. Shobha (6.66 m), and \u001b[91mPramila Aiyappa\u001b[0m. \u001b[94mShe\u001b[0m won the gold medal for her effort.\n\n"
